# Environmental-Monitoring-System-with-ESP32-BME280-OLED-and-SD-Card
A smart IoT-based environmental monitoring system using ESP32, BME280, OLED display, and SD card to measure and visualize temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude via web server and local storage.
# 🌱 ESP32 Environmental Monitoring System

This project is a smart environmental monitoring system using an **ESP32** board along with a **BME280** sensor, an **OLED display**, and an **SD Card Reader**. It allows real-time measurement and display of temperature, humidity, air pressure, and altitude, both on a web server and on an OLED screen. The collected data is also saved to a CSV file on an SD card for future analysis and visualization.
